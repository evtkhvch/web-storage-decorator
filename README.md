## Web Storage Decortor

Do not exceed 80 characters per column for all files: itâ€™s simply much easier to read vertically than horizontally.

This is an element written without any convention:

```html
<input (input)="onInputChanged($event)" *ngIf="canEdit" class="form-control" [attr.placeholder]="placeholder" @fadeIn type="text" />
```
